# My failed attempt at statically compiling Blender
I wanted to have a Blender build that is distributed just like the official one. A ZIP file you just download, extract and run Blender. With one key difference. I wanted to have it run on ARM architectures as well.  
Last time I checked, my build worked on x86_64, but when building it for ARM I kept running into problems with compiling the dependencies for ARM.  
I might come back to this at some point to try and get it working. For now this is here just because I didn't know where else to put it.
